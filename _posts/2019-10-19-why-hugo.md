We’ve looked at a few static site generators and we’ve decided on Hugo for a large website project of ours.

On our site, we present a large amount of information from a large government department. We have large hierarchical structure — the “Information Architecture”.  There many “landing” or “index” pages, with a list of pages underneath. We need to be able to show the whole site structure as a top nav menu. We need to show a breadcrumb trail at the top so users always know where they are in the structure. On the side, we need to show a list of sibling pages, and the parent page. The mobile view will display these items where needed.

Hugo satisfies our requirement of being able to directly use the file system to list sub-folders and sub-pages, and to recursively read up parent directories. 

However learning Hugo is difficult. Often pages seem to appear out of nowhere. Whenever we look at a Hugo theme to try to understand Hugo better, they seem to be implemented in a completely different way. Customising a theme seems almost as hard as making our own from scratch. And what do we do if we can’t find a theme that suits our Information Architecture? And where is the documentation on making a new theme anyway?

So we begin our journey with Hugo. We hope these posts will form a guide that will help others to get their own themes and their own sites up and running in a easy-to-understand way.
